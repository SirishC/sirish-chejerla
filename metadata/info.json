      "description": "I have hands-on experience in software development, automation, and cloud engineering, specializing in Java, Python, and JUnit for building and testing applications. At Genesys, I optimized Voicemail Microservices and Predictive Routing on AWS and Azure, leveraging Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure Blob Storage for scalable deployments. I automated 100+ test scenarios using Selenium and Jest, reducing manual efforts by 40%, and integrated them with Jenkins for continuous testing. Additionally, I managed Linux and Windows test servers, ensured 99.9% uptime, and used Azure Monitor and Grafana for proactive monitoring. My expertise extends to performance testing with JMeter and Postman, CI/CD pipeline management via Jenkins and Azure DevOps, and AI model evaluation using Scikit-learn. I follow Agile methodologies, maintain high coding standards with Git, and create detailed documentation in Markdown and Confluence to streamline development and maintenance.",
